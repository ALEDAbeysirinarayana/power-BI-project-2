# Human Resources Attrition Analysis – Power BI Project

## Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes employee attrition within an organization to identify key factors influencing employee turnover. The dashboard provides
insights into attrition rates, departmental trends, job satisfaction, income patterns, and demographic breakdowns to support HR decision-making.

## Dashboard Summary
The main dashboard presents an interactive overview of employee attrition using
key performance indicators (KPIs) and visual analytics.

### Key KPIs
- **Total Employees:** 100  
- **Total Attrition:** 30  
- **Attrition Rate:** 0.30 (30%)

## Analysis & Visualizations
The dashboard includes the following analyses:

### 1. Attrition by Department
- Displays attrition count across departments such as Sales, Finance, IT, HR,
  and Operations.
- Helps identify departments with higher employee turnover.

### 2. Attrition by Gender and Department
- Matrix visual showing Female, Male, and Total attrition by department.
- Supports diversity and workforce balance analysis.

### 3. Job Satisfaction Analysis
- Average job satisfaction comparison between employees who stayed and those
  who left.
- Sum of job satisfaction grouped by attrition status.

### 4. Tenure-Based Attrition
- Total employees by **Years at Company**, segmented by attrition status.
- Identifies critical time periods where attrition is higher.

### 5. Income-Based Attrition
- Monthly income distribution of employees who left the organization.
- Helps assess whether compensation is a contributing factor.

### 6. Employee-Level Details
- Employee ID and Job Role table for granular inspection.
- Supports drill-down and individual-level analysis.
